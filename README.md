# Harris Corner
Commonly used in computer vision algorithms to extract corners.
Dtecting corner is very important in many fields. It is a point where atleast 2 edges meet.
As edges meet here, we apply similar concept to detect corner in an image, gradient measurement.
We look for points where gradient change is high in all directions.
