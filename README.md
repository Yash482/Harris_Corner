# Harris Corner
Commonly used in computer vision algorithms to extract corners.
Dtecting corner is very important in many fields. It is a point where atleast 2 edges meet.
As edges meet here, we apply similar concept to detect corner in an image, gradient measurement.
We look for points where gradient change is high in all directions.

# Dilation and Erosion
Both are applied to binary images.
Dilation enlarges brightness, while ares in the images by adding pixels to the perceived boundariesof object in the image.
Erosion does the opposite. It removes pixels along the object boundaries and shrinks the size.
